# model-serving agent instructions

- Read README.md and docs/specs/README.md before changing behavior.
- This repository owns its component. Never import lab or assume sibling checkouts.
- Preserve user work, source history, and extraction provenance.
- Keep planned interfaces distinct from executable capabilities; no engine exists yet.
- Declare dependencies explicitly. Do not install GPU stacks or contact providers implicitly.
- Keep datasets, weights, credentials, caches, and large run artifacts outside Git.
- Run focused checks for changed behavior and git diff --check; retain proof limits.
